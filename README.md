# Piano_Cam

## Overview
The **Piano Cam** is an interactive application that allows users to play a virtual piano using hand gestures captured via a webcam. Leveraging **MediaPipe Hands** for hand tracking and **OpenCV** for real-time video processing, this project transforms your hand movements into piano notes. Each key on the virtual piano corresponds to a specific note, and when your hand touches a key, the corresponding sound is played using **Pygame**.

This project is a fun and innovative way to explore the intersection of computer vision, machine learning, and music. Itâ€™s perfect for beginners and enthusiasts interested in AI, computer vision, or music technology.

## Features
- Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe Hands.
- Virtual piano with labeled keys (both white and black keys).
- Play piano notes by touching the virtual keys with your hand.
- Full-screen or centered window display options.
- Easy-to-understand code structure for customization.
